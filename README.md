# Tohono-Chul-
Here we have a comparison of the butterflies seen in Tohono Chul to those seen in Municipal Tucson 
Citizen science is a growing field of the scientific moethod that encourages non-professional methodologies. 
Research grade data has been provided and recorded by public scientisit on sites like iNaturalist and eButterfly. 
Comparisons of citizen science data-gathering approaches to evaluate urban butterfly diversity (Prudic L., Kathleen et. al 2018) has determined that citizen science methods can be used to collect data on butterfly diversity. 
Now we hope to determine if this same methodology can be used to determine scale in urban butterfly diversity. 
The presented data was provided by eButterfly and Andy Hogan from Tohono Chul Nature Park in Tucson Arizona. 
Although the statistical significane of this project has not been determined we see that Tohno Chul has a higher richness and diversity of butterflies when compared to municipal Tucson. 
Statistically analysis to follow.
Special thanks to Keaton Wilson for all of his help and my DDCSP friends.
